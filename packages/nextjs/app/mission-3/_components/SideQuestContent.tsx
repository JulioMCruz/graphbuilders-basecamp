          Welcome to your side quest! The road less-traveled can be long and arduous, but the rewards are often
          lucrative! In this section will you will learn about some key changes you can make to your subgraph to
          optimize performance and perform off-chain calculations of your data.

          The <span className="highlight-code">derivedFrom</span> field is a powerful feature that allows you to
          optimize your subgraph by reducing the amount of data that needs to be indexed. It is used to create
          relationships between entities and can be used to optimize the performance of your subgraph.
